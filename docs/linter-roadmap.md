# OpenAPI and Markdown linter implementation checklist

The approved design uses one configuration version, `version: 1`, with breaking changes allowed. Rule set names have no version suffix. Pin the executable release and review the shipped SHA-256 manifests to reproduce policy. Both commands now default to their recommended set; Portos policy is opt-in through `portos-defaults`.

Implementation updated October 2, 2026. Checked items are implemented; rule behavior, options, and boundaries are documented in `docs/rule-packs.md`. This joint document is mirrored in both repositories. Unperformed customer pilot work is listed separately and is not claimed as completed.

## Existing systems and lessons

These are capability comparisons from primary documentation, not benchmark results or claims of compatibility. The recommendations below are our design choices.

| System | Relevant capabilities | Lesson for our linters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spectral | An OpenAPI ruleset with per-rule recommendation/severity metadata, operation-ID uniqueness, parameter consistency, and version-aware rules. [Rule reference](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/blob/develop/docs/reference/openapi-rules.md) | Provide named sets and metadata; make applicability explicit |
| Redocly CLI | Structural and reference checks alongside API documentation/style checks; built-in and inherited configurations. [Rule catalog](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/built-in-rules), [extends](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/extends) | Separate correctness from customer conventions and document merge order |
| markdownlint | Rule IDs, categories, options, fixes, image alt text, headings, fences, and spacing. Ordered lists support multiple numbering conventions. [Rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md) | Give granular controls and avoid rejecting valid Markdown conventions |
| remark lint | Separate consistency and recommended presets; individual Markdown plugins. [Project documentation](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) | Offer a small recommended set and a separate style set |
| Vale | Declarative prose checks with scopes, messages, guidance links, and styles distributed as packages. [Styles](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/styles), [packages](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/packages) | Start with customer terminology and scoped prose patterns rather than broad grammar judgments |
| textlint | Explicit rule/preset configuration and plugin-based text processing. [Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/textlint/textlint/master/docs/configuring.md) | Keep prose checks opt-in and distinguish activation from installing executable logic |

Our opportunity is to combine existing repository-level document checks and the Go extension API with consistent rule discovery and onboarding across both commands. Do not implement Spectral selectors or JavaScript plugins merely to match another product's configuration language.

## Portos project requirements

The internal requirements are independent rules. In OpenAPI, `portos-defaults` composes `openapi:recommended` and `portos:internal`. In Markdown it composes `markdown:recommended` and `portos:internal`. Each requirement can be configured, scoped, overridden, or suppressed independently.

- [x] `portos.operation-vocabulary`: request Path operation IDs use List, Send, Delete, Query, Get, or Modify; Batch and Async are modifiers. Vocabulary and modifiers are configurable. Create, Update, Search, and Enumerate receive findings.
- [x] `portos.query-request`: Query uses POST and an object body.
- [x] `portos.async-response`: Async successes reference the configurable `AsyncIdentifier` object and expose only the identifier field, default `id`.
- [x] `portos.collection-response`: Query/List success objects contain a `results` array of objects and `paginationContext`. Async responses use their identifier contract.
- [x] `portos.pagination-response`: the response pagination context declares string `nextToken` and integer `maxResults`.
- [x] `portos.path-description`: each request Path Item has a nonblank description, independently of operation descriptions.
- [x] `portos.pagination-request`: List declares nextToken/maxResults query parameters; Query includes these in its object body, directly or under paginationContext.
- [x] `portos.open-enums`: open values use `x-extensible-enum` and corresponding unique `x-enum-varnames`. A normal `enum` is closed and is rejected by this policy.
- [x] `portos.date-fields`: date/time properties use string `format: date-time`, representing RFC 3339. Additional field names are configurable. The requested rfc3999 is interpreted as RFC 3339.
- [x] `portos.batch-contract`: Batch has an items array of objects with IDs and a synchronous results array of objects with IDs; Async Batch uses the async success contract. Field names are configurable. Runtime ID uniqueness/correlation requires service tests.
- [x] `portos.query-graph`: Query request query references the canonical recursive Query model rather than an unrelated filter schema; comparator and boolean graph shapes are checked.
- [x] `portos.name-schema`: data properties named name reference the configurable NameValue object.
- [x] `portos.description-schema`: data properties named description reference the configurable DescriptionValue object; OpenAPI metadata descriptions are unaffected.
- [x] `text.no-dashes`: no hyphens or Unicode dashes in prose, excluding code and URL targets. Markdown bullet/fence syntax is not prose.
- [x] `text.no-load-bearing`: prohibit that phrase in prose, including its spelling with a hyphen; exclude code and URL targets.

Backend evidence: `portos-backend/api/restful_interfaces/components/schemas/Query.yaml`, `QueryComparator.yaml`, `PaginationContext.yaml`, `EndpointQueryRequest.yaml`, and `EndpointQueryResponse.yaml`. The graph contains match, lessThan, greaterThan, and, or, not, patternMatch, and freeformMatch. Comparators have string key/value fields. Response collection and pagination shapes are checked independently because OpenAPI has no Go generics.

The backend spells the field maxResults and currently uses TypeValue for some names. The confirmed NameValue/DescriptionValue names deliberately establish the requested new policy and remain configurable. Backend contracts were inspected but not edited. Schema rules do not prove that running handlers implement those contracts.

## Activation and composition checklist

- [x] A single version 1 schema with extends, rules, overrides, enabled state, severity, scope, options, and reasoned suppressions.
- [x] Recommended defaults with no compatibility branch or versioned preset names.
- [x] Readable YAML sets and SHA-256 manifests embedded for offline use and included in release archives.
- [x] Rule catalog with options, defaults, kinds, severity, preset membership, guidance, and fix support; public customer metadata registration.
- [x] rules list/describe and presets list/describe/export.
- [x] init creates compact config and refuses implicit overwrite.
- [x] config validate checks the full configuration; config explain includes defaults, enabled state, scope decisions, origins, and hashes.
- [x] Explicit config wins; otherwise discover only the conventional config at the selected root.
- [x] Root-bounded local imports, including symlinks, with cycle, duplicate-ID, wrong-kind, and unknown-override errors.
- [x] Overrides replace whole supplied options maps/scope lists; omitted fields inherit. Disabled/unselected options are validated.
- [x] Reasoned suppressions remove fixes too; complete duplicate suppressions are deduplicated. OpenAPI supports exact pointers; Markdown supports next-line directives outside code.
- [x] --only filters configured enabled instance IDs after validation.
- [x] Text severity and deterministic JSON diagnostics with check identity and provenance.
- [x] Explicit baseline creation/replacement, counted debt, moved-line resilience, and changed-evidence detection.
- [x] --fail-on warning and SARIF output using the same diagnostics; operational failures always exit 2.
- [x] Customer Go factories/analyzers remain available; YAML never downloads executable logic.

## Customer UX

The rule-pack reference documents discovery, initialization, activating one rule, composing sets, overrides, scoping, suppression, baselines, and effective-policy review. Both repositories include runnable Portos fixtures. The optional future settings UI should consume this same catalog and YAML contract, with inherited values visible and sample-document previews before saving.

Breaking changes: recommended defaults add findings; configuration must be within the selected root; wrong-kind checks fail rather than silently doing nothing; ordered lists and whitespace permit valid alternative syntax; fixes use the same selected pack as linting rather than silently selecting relocation checks. Select markdown:maintenance explicitly for relocation/ID repair. Pin the executable alongside pack hashes.

## Test checklist

- [x] Rule cases verify identity, severity, source locations, valid shapes, failures, and false-positive exclusions.
- [x] Configuration tests cover replacement, disabled-state overrides, cycles, diamond imports, escapes, provenance, init overwrite protection, and kinds.
- [x] Baseline tests cover duplicate debt, moved lines, changed evidence, and overwrite protection.
- [x] Embedded sets compile against the stock registry.
- [x] Existing library, CLI, filesystem, fix, and customer-extension tests continue to run.
- [x] The Portos fixtures run through their composed sets.
- [x] Decoder fuzz seeds and an executable fuzz target are included.
- [ ] Run an onboarding pilot with real customers: initialization, one override, one exception, and an explanation without help. Do not substitute fabricated pilot results.
- [ ] Establish runtime/memory budgets on representative pinned corpora and named CI hardware; compare selected fixtures with pinned competing linters and record intentional disagreements.

The source graph cache is scoped to one run; embedded-set resolution is cached and returned as independent copies. These choices avoid repeated reference-file parsing without retaining customer inputs across invocations.

## Validation boundaries and future integrations

Structural checking uses dated official OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 schemas, offline. The 3.1 structural schema explicitly excludes Schema Object validation; example checking separately compiles effective schemas. This does not claim complete semantic conformance. Example validation supports JSON-compatible values, recursive local references, 3.0 nullable/bounds conversion, and directional required readOnly/writeOnly fields. External examples are never fetched and unsupported custom dialect analysis fails explicitly.

Standalone schema mode remains YAML-structure checking rather than an advertised JSON Schema conformance engine. The Markdown parser supports CommonMark plus tables, strikethrough, and task lists. MDX/template extensions are not claimed. HTML policy is a style check, not a sanitizer; spelling requires a supplied language and offline vocabulary.

Hosted settings UI and LSP are future integration projects. Exact JSON-pointer suppressions for OpenAPI and reasoned next-line directives for Markdown are implemented. A remote pack registry, external-link fetcher, runtime plugins, API breaking-change comparison, and universal grammar rules remain outside this implementation. API renames, generated alt text, and automatic prose rewriting require author judgment and are not offered as safe fixes.
